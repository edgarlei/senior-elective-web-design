            </figure>
            <p class="para-text">Cam Newton is the dual-threat star quarterback of the Carolina Panthers. Born on May 11, 1989, Newton is 
                6’ 5” and 245 lbs, and attended Westlake High School in Atlanta, Georgia. He committed to the University of Florida and 
                spent most of his two years there as a backup to Tim Tebow. However, after an incident involving the theft of another 
                student’s laptop, as well as three instances of academic dishonesty, Newton transferred to Blinn College. After a year, 
                he was recruited by the University of Auburn. In his first year with the Auburn Tigers, Newton led them to a victory in 
                the 2011 BCS National Championship game, in which they won 22-19 over the University of Oregon’s Ducks. He won the 2010 
                Heisman Trophy in a landslide victory, and was also named the 2010 SEC Offensive Player of the Year and the 2010 AP Player
                 of the Year.</p>
            <p class="para-text">In the 2011 NFL Draft, the Carolina Panthers selected Newton with the first overall pick. In his rookie 
                season, Newton broke many rookie records. His performance quelled doubts that he would not be able to succeed in the NFL.
                 His rookie season performance earned him a spot in the Pro Bowl, as well as the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year and Pepsi 
                 NFL Rookie of the Year awards. His signature celebration earned him the nickname “Superman.” During this season, he started
                  the Panther tradition "Sunday Giveaway", where the Panthers offensive players typically give away the football that they 
                  just scored a touchdown with to kids in the stands. <p>
            <p class="para-text">In the 2012 season, Newton improved in many statistical categories and helped the Panthers improve from a 
                6-10 record in 2011 to a 7-9 record in 2012. In 2013, Newton and the Panthers greatly improved to a 12-4 record and made 
                the playoffs for the first time since 2008. Despite the Panthers losing to the San Francisco 49ers, Newton was selected to 
                the Pro Bowl for the second time. Although he started off the 2014 season with several injuries and having to deal with 
                various more injuries throughout the season, Newton showed remarkable development and growth as a pocket passer. Despite 
                a subpar 7-8-1 record, the Panthers did well enough to win the NFC South division and make the playoffs, both for the second 
                year in a row. They eventually lost to the Seattle Seahawks after defeating the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
            <p class="para-text">In 2015, Newton’s skills greatly improved, and he made a strong case as to why he is an elite quarterback. 
                Before the season started, the Panthers and Newton agreed to a five-year, $103.8 million contract extension. Newton made sure 
                that the Panthers’ money was well-spent, as he led the Panthers to a 15-1 record, the best in the NFL that season, and the 
                top NFC playoff berth, while breaking or setting several records. In the playoffs, the Panthers easily defeated the Seattle 
                Seahawks and then the Arizona Cardinals to make it to Super Bowl 50. The day before the big game, Newton was named the 2015 
                NFL MVP, a first for any Panthers player. Newton and the Panthers’ top-ranked offense faced the Denver Broncos and their 
                vaunted defense. For most of the game, it was a one-score affair. Both defenses played extremely well and made both offenses 
                struggle. Newton was sacked twice and fumbled the ball twice, which helped to seal the victory for the Broncos 24-10. </p>
            <p class="para-text">The 2016 season saw Newton regress substantially. In this season, his accuracy and touchdown total dropped, 
                while his interception count increased. This contributed to the Panthers finishing 6-10. After the 2016 season, Newton had 
                surgery to repair a partially torn rotator cuff on his throwing shoulder. Entering the 2017 season, the injury still affected 
                his performance, as his passing looked rusty and he was more cautious with running with the ball. With many injuries to his 
                receivers, Newton was called on more than ever to lead the Panthers. The Panthers managed to finish 11-5 and make the playoffs, 
                although they were defeated by the New Orleans Saints in a close 31-26 game in the Wild Card Round.</p>
            <h3 class="slabo slabo-head" id="Luke">Luke Kuechly</h3>
            <figure class="figure-left">
            <a href="images/luke-kuechly2.jpg"><img src="images/luke-kuechly2.jpg" alt="Luke Kuechly" width="444px" height="250px"></a>
            <!-- <figcaption>Logo History</figcaption> -->
            </figure>
            <p class="para-text">Luke Kuechly is the starting middle linebacker for the Carolina Panthers. Born on April 20, 1991, 
                Kuechly is 6’ 3” and 238 lbs. He attended St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati before playing college football at 
                Boston College. After now-New York Giants linebacker Mark Herzlich announced that he had to miss the season after 
                being diagnosed with Ewing’s sarcoma, the freshman Kuechly became the starting outside linebacker. He finished the 
                season with a team-leading 158 tackles, a mark that was second nationally and first among freshmen. He was named the 
                2009 ACC Defensive Rookie of the Year. In his sophomore year, Kuechly moved to middle linebacker. At that position, 
                he led the country with 183 tackles, which also broke his team’s single-season tackles record. In the Kraft Fight Hunger 
                Bowl game against the University of Nevada (Reno) Wolf Pack, Kuechly was named the defensive MVP despite Boston College 
                losing 20-13. In the 2011 season, he averaged nearly 16 tackles per game and led the nation with 191 tackles, breaking his 
                own records set a year earlier. For his performance, Kuechly won several accolades, including the Dick Butkus Award, the
                 Bronko Nagurski Trophy, and the Lombardi Award, as well as being named first-team All-American for the third year in a row.</p>
            <p class="para-text">Kuechly decided to forgo his final year of college eligibility and entered the 2012 NFL Draft. Already 
                rated as the top linebacker in the league, his performance in the NFL Combine only served to raise his stock further.
                 He was selected by the Panthers with the ninth overall pick in the first round of the draft. In his rookie season,
                  Kuechly began at outside linebacker. However, after starting middle linebacker Jon Beason was injured, Kuechly 
                  moved to middle linebacker. His performance in lieu of Beason convinced the Panthers’ coaches to make Kuechly the 
                  long-term starter at that position, even after Beason returned from injury. Kuechly’s rookie year performance won
                   him the NFC Defensive Rookie of the Month award for December as well as the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year award. </p>
            <p class="para-text">In his second year in the NFL, Kuechly improved his play to a whole new level. With him as the leader 
                of the Panthers defense, the unit allowed the second-fewest points and yards. In a December game against the New Orleans 
                Saints, Kuechly made 26 tackles, which set a new single game record. Kuechly was named to the 2013 All-Pro Team and was 
                selected to play in the 2014 Pro Bowl. He was also named NFL Defensive Player of the Year, becoming only the second player
                 ever (after New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor) to win the Defensive Rookie of the Year award and Defensive Player 
                 of the Year in successive years. Kuechly continued performing at an elite level in 2014, and was selected to the Pro Bowl 
                 and the NFL All-Pro First Team for the second season in a row.</p>
            <p class="para-text">Early in the season, Kuechly signed a big contract extension that made him the NFL’s highest paid middle
                 linebacker. During the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he suffered a concussion and was out until Week 6.
                  Week in and week out, he continued to anchor the Panthers defense and helped them finish 15-1 and make the playoffs. 
                  Against the Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona Cardinals, Kuechly returned one interception for a touchdown in each game 
                  to help the Panthers win comfortably. Despite recording 10 tackles and one sack in Super Bowl 50, the Panthers lost to 
                  the Denver Broncos 24-10.</p>
            <p class="para-text">Luke Kuechly’s 2016 season ended in Week 11 when he suffered a concussion. Nevertheless, he still managed 
                to record over 100 tackles, two sacks, and one interception. Kuechly started the 2017 season off strong with five tackles 
                and an interception against the San Francisco 49ers. However, in mid-October, he suffered his third concussion in as many 
                years and had to miss almost two weeks. Regardless, Kuechly was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl, his fifth time in a row.</p>

            <h3 class="slabo slabo-head" id="Steve">Steve Smith, Sr.</h3>
            <figure class="figure-left">
            <a href="images/stevesmithsr.jpg"><img src="images/stevesmithsr.jpg" alt="Steve Smith, Sr." width="375px" height="250px"></a>
            <!-- <figcaption>Logo History</figcaption> -->
            </figure>
            <p class="para-text">Born on May 12, 1979 in Los Angeles, California, Steve Smith, Sr. is a former wide receiver for the 
                Carolina Panthers. Although he started out attending Santa Monica College, Smith eventually transferred to the 
                University of Utah. There, he gained national attention and was named the offensive MVP of the 2001 East-West Shrine Game.
                 In the third round of the 2001 NFL Draft, Smith was selected by the Carolina Panthers.</p>
            <p class="para-text">As a rookie, Smith played primarily as a kick and punt returner. In his first NFL play, Smith returned
                 the opening kickoff for a touchdown. Smith became a starting wide receiver in 2002, while also continuing his kick and 
                 punt returning duties. However, his season was marred by two altercations with teammates, the latter of which saw Smith 
                 arrested and briefly jailed, as well as suspended for one game. During the 2003 season, Smith played a pivotal role in 
                 the Panthers’ success and journey to Super Bowl XXXVIII. He finished with 88 receptions for over 1,000 yards and 7 
                 touchdowns in the regular season, while adding a few more crucial touchdowns in the playoffs.  </p>
            <p class="para-text">In the first game of the 2004 season, Smith broke his leg and was out for the rest of the year. However,
                 he managed to rebound in 2005, which was arguably his best season ever. He led the NFL in receiving yards with 1,503,
                  receptions with 101, and touchdowns with 12. Smith’s performance helped the Panthers breeze through the first two
                   rounds of the 2005 NFL playoffs before they were defeated 34-14 by the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship.
                    His performance earned Smith the 2005 NFL Comeback Player of the Year award, which he won with New England Patriots
                     linebacker Tedy Bruschi. Despite preseason injuries in 2006, Smith still managed to record over 80 receptions for
                      1,186 yards and 8 touchdowns while being double covered frequently. At the end of the season, he signed a 6-year 
                      contract extension. In 2007, Smith did almost just as well as he did the previous year, despite playing with four 
                      different quarterbacks.</p>
            <p class="para-text">During the 2008 preseason, Smith was involved in a major scuffle with teammate Ken Lucas. Smith was
                 suspended for two games by the team. Nevertheless, he finished the season leading the NFL in receiving yards per game. 
                 In the penultimate week of the 2009 NFL season, Smith broke his forearm and was out for the rest of the year, which 
                 prevented him from having five consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons. A total lack of team offense behind rookie 
                 quarterback Jimmy Clausen in 2010 saw Smith catch for only 554 yards, by far his worst statistical season. However, 
                 with a new and exciting quarterback in Cam Newton taking the reins, Smith was able to flourish again in 2011, 2012, 
                 and 2013, recording over 1,000 yards receiving in the first two seasons. Late in the 2013 season, Smith suffered a PCL 
                 sprain and was released by the Panthers the following offseason. In total, Smith had made 5 Pro Bowls during his time as a Panther. 
                 He would later sign with the Baltimore Ravens, with whom he’d play for from 2014 until his retirement in 2016.</p>
            <h3 class="slabo slabo-head" id="Sam">Sam Mills</h3>
            <figure class="figure-left">
            <a href="images/sam-mills.jpg"><img src="images/sam-mills.jpg" alt="Sam Mills" width="375px" height="250px"></a>
            <!-- <figcaption>Logo History</figcaption> -->
            </figure>
            <p class="para-text">Sam Mills was born on June 3, 1959, in Neptune City, New Jersey, and attended Long Branch High School. 
                Despite being a great athlete in high school, Mills’ 5’ 9” stature didn’t interest college scouts. He made the Montclair
                 State University football team as a walk-on and excelled in college. In 1981, he signed with the Cleveland Browns, but
                  was released after the preseason. Similarly, he signed with the Canadian Football League’s Toronto Argonauts in 1982 
                  but was released again. In 1983, he tried out and made it onto the roster of Philadelphia Stars in the short-lived USFL. 
                  In his three seasons on the Stars, he became known for his tenacity and leadership despite his size. After the Stars won 
                  the 1985 USFL title, Mills followed Stars head coach Jim Mora to the New Orleans Saints, with whom Mora had been hired 
                  as the head coach. Playing for the Saints from 1986 to 1994, Mills led a stellar defense and was voted to the Pro Bowl 4 
                  times. However, after becoming a free agent at the end of the 1994 season, he signed with the newly founded Carolina 
                  Panthers after the Saints were slow to make a new contract offer to him. He became an experienced veteran leader for the 
                  young Panthers team and was the only player to start every game in the Panthers’ first three seasons. His pick-six against 
                  the New York Jets helped secure the Panthers their first ever win in franchise history, and he was voted to the Pro Bowl 
                  that year. After the 1997 season, Mills retired.</p>
            <p class="para-text">What makes him a key figure in Panthers history is not what he did during a time as a player, but rather 
                what he did after his career. After his retirement, Mills was inducted into the Carolina Panthers Hall of Honor. Mills 
                became a defensive coaching assistant for the Panthers in 1998 before being promoted to the role of linebackers coach the 
                following year.</p>
            <p class="para-text">In August 2003, Mills was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Although he was told he had only a few months 
                to live, he underwent chemotherapy and radiation and continued to coach. He was an inspirational force in the Panthers’ 
                journey to Super Bowl XXXVIII. On a cold, overcast Friday in January 2004, then-coach John Fox gathered the team on the 
                practice field near Bank of America Stadium. The day after, the team would begin its run to Super Bowl XXXVIII with a game 
                against the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round. Mills wanted to make a speech. He spoke of how he went from being an 
                overlooked college football player to being a five-time Pro Bowl player. He spoke of he was diagnosed with intestinal cancer 
                hours before he showed up to coach the linebackers in the last Panthers preseason game of 2003 and that he was given only 
                three months to live. He told the players that they became his inspiration to fight the tough days of chemotherapy treatments 
                when, on September 14, they blocked an extra point on the final play of regulation to send a sure loss against the Tampa Bay 
                Buccaneers into overtime, where they won. What really resonated with the players were the following words: "When I found out 
                I had cancer, there were two things I could do: quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. 
                Keep pounding!"</p>
            <p class="para-text">He continued to coach the team during the 2004 season, but after battling with cancer for almost two years, 
                Mills died at his home in Charlotte, North Carolina on the morning of April 18, 2005. Though Mills was gone, his words lived 
                on, and “Keep Pounding” was soon adopted as the team’s motto. </p>
