        <p class="para-text">In 1987, the city of Charlotte, North Carolina was awarded a NBA expansion team (the Hornets). 
            Shortly afterwards, on July 16, former Baltimore (now Indianapolis) Colts wide receiver, North Carolina native 
            and businessman Jerry Richardson met with a group of interested financial backers to discuss the prospect of 
            bringing an NFL team to the Carolinas. On December 15, Richardson officially announced a bid for an NFL franchise, 
            and his company, Richardson Sports, selected a site in uptown Charlotte to be the future home of a privately financed 
            NFL stadium that could seat over 70,000 fans. </p>
        <p class="para-text">This announcement was met with overwhelming support from the people 
            of the Carolinas. US Senators Jesse Helms (R-NC) and Ernest Hollings (D-SC) worked together to lobby NFL owners to 
            support the bid. At the same time, then-Governors Jim Martin (R-NC) and Carroll Campbell, Jr. (R-SC) created a citizen 
            committee to help the cause. From 1989 to 1991, NFL preseason games between existing teams were held in the Carolinas. 
            Fans showed their support by selling out all three games in Raleigh, NC, Chapel Hill, NC, and Columbia, SC, respectively. 
            In the spring of 1992, the NFL reduced the list of expansion candidate cities from eleven to seven, and then from seven 
            to five. However, a labor dispute between the NFL and its players delayed the expansion vote until 1993. After they resolved 
            their dispute early that year, the vote was set to go ahead. That June, Richardson Sports revealed its plan to privately 
            finance (without the use of public taxpayer money) the stadium from the sale of Permanent Seat Licenses (PSLs), club seats, and luxury boxes. By the end of the first day, 
            all 8,314 club seats were sold out, all 104 luxury suites were reserved, and over 40,000 PSLs were purchased. </p>
        <p class="para-text">Finally, on October 
            26, 1993, NFL owners unanimously selected the Carolinas to receive the 29th NFL franchise (Jacksonville (Jaguars) getting the 
            30th franchise a month later). There were fireworks displays in downtown Charlotte as enthusiastic fans celebrated the news. 
            Richardson, the Panthers’ owner/founder, said, “This is a dream come true for me and my partners and the 10 million people 
            in the Carolinas.”</p>

        <p class="para-text">The Panthers signed Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Dom Capers to be their first head coach. 
            During the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft and NFL Draft, the Panthers began to fill up their roster, and in the latter draft, 
            selected QB Kerry Collins in the first round. In free agency, the team signed several decent players, including LB Sam 
            Mills and K John Kasay. Bill Polian, who had been the general manager of the Buffalo Bills when they won four consecutive
             AFC championships years earlier, was hired as the Panthers’ first general manager. He brought with several Bills players, 
             including QB Frank Reich, TE Pete Metzelaars, and WR Don Beebe. In the annual preseason Hall of Fame Game, the Panthers 
             defeated fellow expansion team the Jacksonville Jaguars 20-14.</p>

            <figcaption>Memorial Stadium</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">Because the Panthers stadium in Charlotte was still under construction, the team’s home games for their 
            inaugural season were played at Clemson University’s Memorial Stadium in South Carolina. Though this was only a temporary 
            home, this gives the Panthers the distinction of being the only sports team in one of the Big Four leagues (MLB, NBA, NHL, 
            and NFL) to be based out of South Carolina. </p>

        </figure>    
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers began their inaugural season with five consecutive losses before beating the New York Jets 
            26-15 on October 15, 1995 (Week 7) to achieve their first home win and first win overall. This was the first win in a 
            streak of four wins that culminated in a 13-7 win over the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers in Week 10. 
            The Panthers eventually finished 7-9, setting a new record for a first year expansion team.</p>
        <figure class="figure-right">

            <figcaption>Ericsson Stadium</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers made several good transactions in the offseason, drafting RB Tim Biakabutuka and WR Muhsin 
            Muhammad in the 1996 NFL Draft, and picking up QB Steve Beuerlein, TE Wesley Walls, and Hall of Fame LB Kevin Greene. The 
            Panthers began playing in the newly completed Ericsson Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina and won their first game in the 
            new stadium 29-6 in Week 1 over the Atlanta Falcons. Their 12-4 record was marked by being undefeated at home and a 7-game 
            winning streak to end the season. In the Panthers’ first ever playoff game, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 26-17 in the
             Divisional Round before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers 30-13 the following week in the NFC 
             Championship. Nevertheless, making it this far was an impressive achievement for a team that was only in its second year 
             (fellow expansion team Jacksonville finished 9-7, also making the playoffs before losing in the AFC Championship 20-6 to 
             the New England Patriots). Eight Panthers players were nominated to the Pro Bowl, while Dom Capers won Coach of the Year.</p>
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers again had a good offseason, drafting S Mike Minter and TE Kris Mangum while picking up 
            undrafted free agent RB Fred Lane. Though they were expected to make the playoffs again after the previous year’s 
            impressive performance, they finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs. The Panthers’ performance didn’t improve in the 
            following season. They started off losing seven games in a row and ended up finishing 4-12. Starting QB Kerry Collins 
            was released, and head coach Dom Capers was fired at the end of the 1998 season.</p>

            <figcaption>Goerge Seifert</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">Capers was replaced by George Seifert, who had won two Super Bowls as the head coach of the San Francisco 
            49ers. In Seifert’s first season, the Panthers finished 8-8 and barely missed out on the playoffs due to several tiebreakers. 
            One main problem was the defense's inability to get defensive stops and put the ball back in the offense's hands. The next season, 
            they finished 7-9, missing the playoffs for the fourth season in a row. In the 2001 NFL draft, the Panthers 
            drafted several outstanding players in LB Dan Morgan, DT Kris Jenkins, and WR Steve Smith. However, the team finished 1-15 
            and Seifert was fired after the 2001 season.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">Having finished at the bottom of the defensive rankings in 2001, the Panthers hired New York Giants defensive 
            coordinator John Fox to be their next head coach. In the 2002 NFL Draft, the Panthers selected UNC defensive end Julius Peppers 
            with the second overall pick, as well as RB DeShaun Foster and LB Will Witherspoon in later rounds. Under Fox, the Panthers 
            improved to 7-9 and had the NFL’s second-best defense.</p>
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers drafted OT Jordan Gross in the first round of the 2003 NFL Draft, and signed QB Jake Delhomme, 
            RB Stephen Davis, and WR Ricky Proehl in the offseason. The 2003 season for the Panthers was marked with tragedy as former 
            linebacker and coach Sam Mills was diagnosed with intestinal cancer and linebacker Mark Fields was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s 
            lymphoma. These struggles helped inspire the Panthers throughout the season.</p>

        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">Although Rodney Peete began the season as the starting quarterback, Jake Delhomme replaced him halfway 
            through the first game and eventually led the Panthers to an 11-5 record, making the playoffs for the first time since the 
            1996 season. In the playoffs, the Panthers defeated the Dallas Cowboys 29-10, the St. Louis Rams 29-23 in double overtime, 
            and the Philadelphia Eagles 14-3. For the first time in franchise history, the Panthers played in the Super Bowl. In Super 
            Bowl XXXVIII in Houston against New England Patriots, the game remained scoreless until five minutes before halftime, and the 
            Patriots led 14-10 going into halftime. After several back-and-forth scoring drives, the score was tied 29-29 with 1:08 left 
            in the game. On the ensuing kickoff, Panthers kicker John Kasay kicked the ball out of bounds, giving the Patriots the ball on 
            their own 40-yard line. With four seconds left, Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri, who had missed two field goals in the game 
            already, made a 41-yard field goal to break the tie and win the game for the Patriots.</p>
        <p class="para-text">The 2003 Panthers were given the nickname “The Cardiac Cats” due to the fact that they won seven games by 
            three points or fewer, won four of five overtime games, and led the NFL in comeback wins during the season.</p>
        <figure class="figure-right">
            <a href="images/bank-of-america-stadium.png"><img src="images/bank-of-america-stadium.png" alt="Bank of America Stadium" width="320px" height="180px"></a>
            <figcaption>Bank of America Stadium</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers were heavily predicted to repeat their 2003 success in 2004. Having lost none of their key 
            players and having drafted CB Chris Gamble in the 2004 NFL Draft, the team looked bound for success in their 10th Anniversary 
            season. However, a multitude of injuries led them to start 1-7, before backup players stepped up and led the Panthers to a 7-9 
            record after finishing 6-2. They barely missed out on the playoffs after missing a field goal and losing the final game of the 
            season. During that year, Bank of America bought the naming rights to the Panthers’ stadium, and it was renamed Bank of America 
            Stadium.</p>
        <p class="para-text">In 2005, the Panthers returned to the playoffs. They won their last game to finish 11-5 and secure the NFC’s 
            #5 seed. They defeated the New York Giants soundly 23-0, but a 29-21 victory over the Chicago Bears the following week turned 
            out to be a pyrrhic victory. Several key players had been injured in that game, and this contributed to the Panthers’ loss to 
            the Seattle Seahawks 34-14 in the NFC Championship.</p>
        <figure class="figure-left">
            <a href="images/deangelo-williams.png"><img src="images/deangelo-williams.png" alt="DeAngelo Williams" width="256px" height="169px"></a>
            <figcaption>DeAngelo Williams</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers drafted RB DeAngelo Williams in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Excitement and hopes 
            were high for the team, and stadium tickets sold out fifteen minutes after going on sale. However, they finished 8-8 and 
            missed the playoffs. The following season, they missed the playoffs again, finishing 7-9 after starting QB Jake Delhomme 
            was injured early in the season. This forced the Panthers to rely on a combination of QBs: 44-year-old Vinny Testaverde, 
            rookie Matt Moore, and the unpopular David Carr.</p>
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers returned to playoffs in 2008 with a 12-4 record. The drafting of RB Jonathan Stewart, who 
            was split running back carries with DeAngelo Williams, gave the Panthers a much improved rushing attack. However, despite
             doing well enough in the regular season to earn a first-round bye in the playoffs, the Panthers lost 33-13 in the Divisional 
             Round to the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
        <p class="para-text">The Panthers disappointed in 2009, finishing 8-8 and missing out on the playoffs. During the 2010 offseason, 
            the Panthers lost several key players. QB Jake Delhomme was released, and later signed with the Cleveland Browns. Star defensive 
            end Julius Peppers was left as an unrestricted free agent after the Panthers refused to put the franchise tag on him, and he 
            later signed with the Chicago Bears. Poor play led the Panthers to finish with a 2-14 record, giving them the first pick in next 
            year’s draft. Within days of the end of the season, head coach John Fox, along with most of the coaching staff, was fired.</p>

        <h3 id="NewtonRivera" class="slabo slabo-head">2011 - present: Cam Newton / Ron Rivera era</h3>

            <figcaption>Cam Newton</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">A few months after Fox’s firing, former Chicago Bears linebacker and San Diego Chargers defensive coordinator 
            Ron Rivera was hired. With the first overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, the Panthers selected Heisman Trophy and NCAAF National 
            Championship-winning QB Cam Newton. This pick was controversial since Newton’s ability to play in the NFL was widely doubted. 
            However, in his rookie year, the dual-threat QB broke several records, including Peyton Manning’s rookie passing yards record 
            and the record for mush rushing TDs by a QB in one season. Under the leadership of Newton and Rivera, the Panthers finished 
            6-10 in 2011, and Newton won the Rookie of the Year award.</p>
        <p class="para-text">In the 2012 NFL draft, the Panthers selected LB Luke Kuechly in the first round, as well as CB Josh Norman 
            in the fifth round. Although they started the season 2-8, with many late-game collapses, they managed to rebound and win 
            five of their last six games to finish 7-9. Although longtime general manager Marty Hurney was fired mid-season and the 
            Panthers didn’t make the playoffs, the strong finish helped Rivera save his job. Kuechly won Defensive Rookie of the Year.</p>
        <figure class="figure-left">

            <figcaption>Luke Kuechly</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">Newton’s abilities and Rivera’s leadership once again were questioned when the Panthers began the 2013 
            season 1-3. However, an 8-game win streak mid-season propelled them to a 12-4 record and the NFC’s #2 seed, which came 
            with a first-round bye. Despite a solid record and regular season performance, they lost in the Divisional Round to the 
            San Francisco 49ers 23-10. Rivera won Coach of the Year, while Kuechly won Defensive Player of the Year, becoming the 
            first Panther to win the award.</p>
        <p class="para-text">Unlike in 2013, the Panthers started off well in 2014. They managed to recover from a 6-game losing streak 
            and won their last four games to finish 7-8-1. Despite their subpar record, they did well enough to win the NFC South division 
            and make the playoffs as the NFC’s #4 seed. They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 27-16 in the Wild Card Round before losing to 
            the Seattle Seahawks 31-17 a week later in the Divisional Round.</p>
        <p class="para-text">Having made the playoffs for the last two years, the Panthers hoped to continue that streak in 2015. Before 
            the season started, however, WR Kelvin Benjamin tore his ACL and was out for the entire season. Nevertheless, they finished 
            with a franchise-best and season-best 15-1 record, only losing to the Atlanta Falcons 20-13 in Week 16. Entering the playoffs 
            with the NFC’s #1 seed and a first round bye, they defeated a familiar foe, the Seattle Seahawks, in the Divisional Round 31-24 
            before handily defeating the Arizona Cardinals 49-15 in the NFC Championship. Although 10 Panthers, a franchise record, had been 
            selected to the Pro Bowl, all of them declined to play, as is customary, since the Panthers were to face the Denver Broncos in
             Super Bowl 50.</p>
        <figure class="figure-right">
            <a href="images/ron-rivera.png"><img src="images/ron-rivera.png" alt="Ron Rivera" width="261px" height="174px"></a>

        </figure>
        <p class="para-text">Super Bowl 50 turned out to be a low-scoring game, as both defenses played well. In the first quarter, Broncos 
            linebacker stripped Newton of the ball, and Broncos defensive lineman Malik Jackson recovered it in the endzone to increase the 
            Broncos’ lead to 10-0. Entering halftime, the score was 13-7 in favor of the Broncos. In the fourth quarter, Miller again stripped 
            Newton of the ball, and the Broncos recovered it. Despite gaining 315 yards to the Broncos’ 194 yards and poor quarterback 
            performances from both Newton and Peyton Manning, the Broncos won 24-10. Nevertheless, Newton won the NFL MVP and Offensive 
            Player of the Year awards (both Panther firsts), while Rivera won Coach of the Year for the second time.</p>
        <p class="para-text">In 2016, the Panthers became the first team in NFL history to go 15-1 and miss the playoffs the following year, 
            as well as the first team to go 15-1 and finish last in their division the next year. They were also the first runners-up to miss 
            the playoffs the next year since the 2008 New England Patriots. This year turned out to be Newton’s worst statistical year, and 
            the Panthers finished 6-10. After the season, team president Danny Morrison resigned, while defensive coordinator Sean McDermott 
            was hired by the Buffalo Bills to be their next head coach.</p>
        <p class="para-text">A month before the start of the 2017 season, general manager Dave Gettleman was fired by the Panthers, and 
            his predecessor Marty Hurney became the interim GM. Notable offseason signings included OT Matt Kalil, the brother of longtime 
            Panthers C Ryan Kalil, as well as former Panthers Captain Munnerlyn and Julius Peppers. In mid-December, owner Jerry Richardson 
            was being investigated for “workplace misconduct,” and a few days later, he issued a statement that announced that he was putting 
            the team up for sale at the end of the season. Despite this, the Panthers managed to go 11-4 entering the final week. Despite 
            having a chance to win their division if they beat the Atlanta Falcons, the Panthers lost, giving the New Orleans Saints the 
            division title. Entering the playoffs with an 11-5 record and the NFC’s #5 seed, the Panthers faced the Saints, a team which 
            had defeated them twice already this season, for the third time. This playoff game turned out to be a much closer affair than 
            the two regular season games, but the Panthers still lost 31-26.</p>
