        <p class="para-text">The shape of the Panthers logo was designed to mimic the outline of both North Carolina and South Carolina. 
            In 2012, the Panthers changed their logo and logotype, the first such change in team history. The changes were designed to 
            give their logo an "aggressive, contemporary look" and a more 3D feel and several details were tweaked to 
            create a more menacing look. The revised logo uses a darker shade of blue. The logotype has been refined 
            to be a modern reflection of the Panthers brand and was inspired by the swift, sleek nature of a panther.</p>

        <p class="para-text">By October 1993, when the Panthers were announced as the 29th NFL team, they had already finalized their 
            logo and helmet design. However, the team uniforms were still a work in progress. Eventually, they decided on white, black, 
            and blue jerseys and white and silver pants. The exact shade of blue that was chosen was “process blue,” which was a shade 
            described as being lighter than Duke’s and darker than North Carolina’s (both being well-known colleges in North Carolina). 
            Since then, the team’s uniforms have remained largely the same. This is mainly in part due to team owner/founder Jerry 
            Richardson, a self-described traditionalist, saying that no major uniform changes would be made in his lifetime.</p>
        <p class="para-text">Of the Panthers’ three jersey colors, their blue alternate uniforms are the newest, having only been 
            introduced in 2002. As per NFL rules, the Panthers are allowed to wear these uniforms up to two times per season. Usually,
             the white jerseys have been paired with white pants, while the blue jerseys and silver jerseys have been paired with silver 
             pants. However, there have been several exceptions. In a 2012 game against the Denver Broncos, the Panthers wore black 
             jerseys with new black pants, paired with their traditional silver helmets and blue socks. The choice of blue socks was made 
             by team captain Steve Smith, Sr., who thought the pop of blue color made the uniforms a distinct appearance compared to other 
             teams’ all-black uniforms. This turned out to be an excellent combination, as it was deemed the “Greatest Uniform in NFL 
             History” by fans in an NFL.com fan-voted contest in July 2013. That same month, the Panthers’ team equipment manager said 
             that the Panthers intended to use the all-black uniforms more in the future. As part of Nike’s “Color Rush” series, the 
             Panthers debuted an all-blue uniform in their 2015 Thanksgiving Day game against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>
        <p class="para-text">After Nike became the NFL’s jersey supplier in 2012, the team’s uniforms didn’t change significantly. 
            However, the collar was altered by featuring the phrase “Keep Pounding,” an homage to former Panthers player and coach 
            Sam Mills. Nike had come up with the idea, and the team supported it as a way to expose newer fans to the legacy of Mills, 
            who died of cancer in 2005.</p>

        <!-- </figure> -->
        <p class="para-text">Opened in the summer of 1996, Bank of America Stadium is located in uptown Charlotte and was specifically 
            designed for football. The 75,525-seat, privately-financed, open-air, natural grass stadium is designed as a self-contained 
            headquarters for the Carolina Panthers and includes training facilities, practice fields and administrative offices. The 
            stadium and adjacent practice fields are located on 33 acres of land in uptown Charlotte. The stadium site has access to 
            30,000 parking spaces in the uptown area with easy access to restaurants and hotel rooms in the stadium's immediate vicinity. </p>
        <p class="para-text">The stadium facade features many unique elements, such as massive arches and towers at the entries, clad in 
            building materials that accent the Panthers' black, silver and blue team colors. The interior has been designed to provide a 
            generous ratio of concession and restroom facilities among wide and tall concourses in addition to individual cup and program 
            holders, wide seats and state-of-the-art sound, video and scoreboard systems. </p>
        <p class="para-text">A five-year renovation project for the stadium began during the 2014 offseason, and updated many aspects of 
            the stadium to keep it up-to-date and to make the fan experience as best as possible. In 2014, 4 escalator bays were added, 
            as well as HD video boards, ribbon boards, and a state-of-the-art sound system. In 2015, all 153 suites were redone, with new 
            features including more rows of seating, fully retractable windows, radiant heat and more televisions. The antenna system was 
            also upgraded to improve cellular service throughout the stadium. In 2016, many renovations were made that focused on improving 
            security and Internet connectivity. Walk-through magnetometers were installed at all stadium entrances, and Wi-Fi service was 
            enhanced with more than 1,200 access points. New signage was installed on the upper level concourse, and digital menu boards and 
            increased points of sale were added to concession stands. The lower level concourse saw similar renovations in 2017. Also, all 
            eight silver club lounges were redesigned and the field was rebuilt as new irrigation and drainage systems were installed.</p>

        <p class="para-text"><a href="images/sir_purr_bio.jpg"><span class="lol">Sir Purr</span></a> is the official mascot of the Carolina Panthers. He is an anthropomorphized panther wearing a Panthers 
            football jersey, No.00. Sir Purr purr-forms at a variety of events, from private birthdays to charity events. Throughout the years, 
            he has been consistently and frequently involved with the Carolinas community. Through the Purr’s Pals program, Sir Purr teams up 
            with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Charlotte to provide a Big and Little with a lifetime memory. During the week of each 
            Panthers home game, a Big and Little share the un-fur-gettable experience of a purr-sonal behind the scenes tour of Bank of 
            America Stadium. A highlight of the tour is a sir-prise visit by Sir Purr, who presents the Big and Little with an even bigger 
            sir-prise, tickets to a Panthers home game and the paw-some thrill of delivering the game ball into the stadium. Every month, 
            Sir Purr visits the patients at the Levine Children's Hospital at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte and brings smiles to their 
            faces. The 10th floor of the hospital features a special Panthers theme that includes pictures, decorations and other items that 
            can be enjoyed by the children and their families as they receive state-of-the-art care. Sir Purr hosts the annual Sir Purr Bowl, 
            an annual gridiron grudge match between professional and college mascots that takes place at halftime of a Panthers home game each 
            season as popular mascots play a full-contact football game. Sir Purr caused a stir during Week 16 of the 1996 NFL season, when the 
            Panthers were playing the Pittsburgh Steelers. On a Panthers punt that landed in the endzone, he jumped on the ball even though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1573&v=uGSitlPA9Mc"><span class="lol">it 
            was still live.</span></a> This turned the play into a touchback, and Sir Purr was subsequently recorded as having 1 punt return for 0 yards.

        <p class="para-text">Sam Mills signed with the Panthers as a free agent in the 1994 offseason. After playing for the Panthers from 
            1995 to 1997, he retired. Immediately upon retiring, Mills became a defensive coaching assistant for the Panthers before being
             promoted to the role of linebackers coach in 1999. </p>
        <p class="para-text">In August 2003, Mills was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Although he was told he had only a few months to 
            live, he underwent chemotherapy and radiation and continued to coach. He was an inspirational force in the Panthers’ journey to
             Super Bowl XXXVIII. On a cold, overcast Friday in January 2004, then-coach John Fox gathered the team on the practice field near
              Bank of America Stadium. The day after, the team would begin its run to Super Bowl XXXVIII with a game against the Dallas Cowboys 
              in the Divisional Round. Mills would deliver a powerful and inspirational speech. "When I found out I had cancer, there were two 
              things I could do: quit or keep pounding," Mills said that day. "I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters, too. Keep 
              pounding!" </p>
        <p class="para-text">He continued to coach the team during the 2004 season, but after battling with cancer for almost two years, 
            Mills died at his home in Charlotte, North Carolina on the morning of April 18, 2005. Though Mills was gone, his words lived 
            on, and “Keep Pounding” was soon adopted as the team’s motto.
            </p>
        <p class="para-text">In 2012, the Panthers introduced the Keep Pounding Drum, inspired by Mills’ aforementioned speech. Before 
            every home game, an honorary drummer hits the six-foot tall drum four times to signify the four quarters of an American 
            football game. According to the team, the drummers "come from a variety of backgrounds and occupations, but all have overcome 
            a great trial or adversity that has not only made them strong but also pushes them to make others around them stronger." 
            Such drummers include 2-time NBA MVP and Charlotte native Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors.</p>
